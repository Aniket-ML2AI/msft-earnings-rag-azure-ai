Or is the environment too tricky for that? And then when it relates to investment, Amy, you've been able to keep overall opex growth very low, and it was very low this quarter.

Overall, there are multiple things, Keith, that are all happening, obviously, simultaneously. If you just take Azure and try to characterize where is the growth for Azure coming from or what sort of drivers for Azure numbers, there are three things all happening in parallel. Like, for example, take cloud migrations.\n\nA good reminder of where we are and even the core cloud migration story is the new Oracle announcement. Once we announce that the Oracle databases are going to be available on Azure, we saw a bunch of unlock from new customers who have significant Oracle estates that have not yet moved to the cloud because they needed to run the GUI with the rest of the app estate in one single cloud. And so, we're excited about that.

And that cycle continues. We'll lap some of those optimization cycles that were fairly extreme perhaps in the second half of our fiscal. And the third thing is, for us, that's unique and different is new workload starts around AI.\n\nGiven our leadership position, we are seeing complete new project starts, which are AI projects. And as you know, AI projects are not just about AI meters. They have lots of other cloud meters as well.

And it speaks to, I think, some of the improvements we're making in Azure and even Microsoft 365 gross margins, even in the core of the commercial cloud.

AI has been far stronger than expected, beat your guidance for Azure this quarter. And while you discussed higher utilization and more GPUs have helped, has the fact that Microsoft has a full AI dev stack, Copilot reference architecture and plug-in architecture, been a meaningful factor not just from a revenue perspective, but also even potentially from a margin perspective?

So, therefore, I think there is a fundamental approach we took, which was a technical approach of saying we'll have Copilots and Copilot stack all available. That doesn't mean we don't have people doing training for open-source models or proprietary models.\n\nWe also have a bunch of open-source models. We have a bunch of fine-tuning happening, a bunch of RLHF happening. So, there's all kinds of ways people use it, but the thing is we have scale leverage of one large model that was trained and one large model that's been used for inference across all our first-party SaaS apps, as well as our API in our Azure AI service.\n\nAmy Hood -- Chief Financial Officer"}, {"metadata": {"source": "data\\MSFT_q1_2024.txt", "last_update": "2024-06-01T18:11:49-00:00", "id": "doc-59-MSFT_q1_2024"}, "content": "Amy Hood -- Chief Financial Officer\n\nAnd the reason, Mark, that's important is that it means, even beyond the point Satya made, is that when it comes to our ability to leverage the infrastructure that we're building out, we don't really have a preference in terms of how people are utilizing that infrastructure, whether it's through all the means that Satya mentioned. It gives us a good opportunity to see quick conversion into revenue. \n\nSatya Nadella -- Chief Executive Officer\n\nYeah.

Maybe I'll take that. Satya, if you want to add. In general, our seat growth has -- it does come from all segments but with a particular strength in small and midsized businesses, as well as what we call the frontline worker opportunity.\n\nAnd then that has been, I would say, looking back a number of quarters, where the majority of our seat growth has gone. And while obviously, it's slowed a bit, to your point, I think the fact that we're still able to add seats at this level speaks to the broadening nature of what Microsoft 365 needs. It's more applicable to more people.

Or are you at the point where Azure has got to kind of scale where Microsoft could sustain high margins even with an ambitious AI investment cycle?\n\nAmy Hood -- Chief Financial Officer\n\nThanks for that question. I think there are a couple of things going on. I would say, in particular, this was a very good leverage quarter in that segment. Number one, the Azure revenue growth and the stability we're seeing in it absolutely is a help to operating leverage.\n\nThe second component of that is our core Azure business. The team continues to deliver thoughtful gross margin improvement across both technical decisions, software implementations. Our teams on the infrastructure build side have done really good work to deliver that. And so, that's been helpful as well."}, {"metadata": {"source": "data\\MSFT_q1_2024.txt", "last_update": "2024-06-01T18:11:49-00:00", "id": "doc-71-MSFT_q1_2024"}, "content": "And then, of course, on operating expenses, there's been a good focus on continuing even within that segment to make sure we're focusing that work leading in the AI transition with Azure.

Thank you very much for taking the question. Maybe just a follow-up to what Brent was just asking about but on the gross margin line. Amy, the Microsoft Cloud gross margin is up 2 points year over year, excluding the useful life change, a little more improvement than we've seen in some time.\n\nAnd some investors were worried that it might go in the other direction given increased AI investments.

I mean I should have mentioned all the consumer workloads use the same frame. And so, when you think about our investment in AI, yes, it will -- because we're committed to leading this wave and see demand, you will see that impact in COGS growth.

So none of the large model training stuff is in any of our higher numbers at all. What small batch training, so somebody is doing fine-tuning or what have you, that will be there, but that's sort of a minor part. So most of what you see in the Azure number is broadly inferencing.\n\nAnd Mark, I think it may be helpful to sort of think about, like what is the new workload in AI? The new workload in AI, obviously, in our case starts with one of the frontier -- I mean, starts with the Frontier model Azure OpenAI. But it's not just about just one model, right?

So I think that's what's happening.\n\nSo you could even say these AI workloads themselves will have a lifecycle which is they'll get rebuilt, then there'll be continuously optimized over time. So that's sort of one side. And I think if I understand your question, what's happening with the traditional optimization, and I think last quarter we said.

We do point out that in Q2 because of the impact of the charge a year ago, you're seeing larger margin improvement than I would say sort of a run-rate margin improvement."}, {"metadata": {"source": "data\\MSFT_q2_2024.txt", "last_update": "2024-08-30T18:11:49-00:00", "id": "doc-60-MSFT_q2_2024"}, "content": "So let me first say that. Secondly, the absolute margin improvement has also been very good and it speaks to, I think one of the things Satya talked about and I reiterated a bit, which is that we really to make sure we're making investments, we're making them and consistently across the tech stack. The tech stack we're building, no matter what team is on is inclusive of AI enablement. And so think about as building that consistency without needing to add a lot of resources to do that."}, {"metadata": {"source": "data\\MSFT_q2_2024.txt", "last_update": "2024-08-30T18:11:49-00:00", "id": "doc-61-MSFT_q2_2024"}, "content": "It's been a real pivot of our entire investment infrastructure to be working on this work and I think that's important because it means you're shifting to an AI-first position, not just in the language we use but in what people are working on day-to-day, that does obviously create leverage opportunity. There has also been really good work put in by many teams on improving the gross margin of the products, we talked about it was Office 365, we talked about in Azure core. We even talked about it across our devices portfolio, where we've seen material improvements over the course of the year. And so when you kind of take improvements at the gross margin level, plus this consistency of repivoting our workforce toward the AI-first work we're doing without adding material number of people to the workforce, you end up with that type of leverage."}, {"metadata": {"source": "data\\MSFT_q2_2024.txt", "last_update": "2024-08-30T18:11:49-00:00", "id": "doc-62-MSFT_q2_2024"}, "content": "And we still need to be investing. And so the important part, invest toward the thing that's going to shape the next decade and continue to stay focused on being able to deliver your day-to-day commitments.

Joe, next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Kash Rangan with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed.\n\nKash Rangan -- Goldman Sachs -- Analyst\n\nHi. Thank you very much. A superb quarter of great improvements. One -- just one question for you, Satya.\n\nCloud computing changed the tech stack in ways that we could not imagine 10 years back, the nature of the database layer or the operating system layer, every layer just changed dramatically. How do you foresee generative AI changing the tech stack as we know it? Thank you so much."}, {"metadata": {"source": "data\\MSFT_q2_2024.txt", "last_update": "2024-08-30T18:11:49-00:00", "id": "doc-63-MSFT_q2_2024"}, "content": "Satya Nadella -- Chief Executive Officer\n\nYeah. I think it's going to have a very foundational impact. In fact, you can say the core compute architecture itself changes, everything from power, power density to the data center design, to what used to be the accelerator, now is the sort of the main CPU, so to speak, or the main compute unit. And so I think in the network, the memory architecture, all of it, so as the core computer architecture changes, I think every workload changes."}, {"metadata": {"source": "data\\MSFT_q2_2024.txt", "last_update": "2024-08-30T18:11:49-00:00", "id": "doc-64-MSFT_q2_2024"}, "content": "And so yes, so there is a full, like, take our data layer, the most exciting thing for me in the last year has been to see how our data layer has evolved to be built for AI, right? If you think about Fabric, one of the genius of Fabric is to be able to say, let's separate out storage from the compute layer, in compute we'll have traditional sequels that have Spark, and by the way, you can have an Azure AI job on-top of the same data lake, so to speak, or the lake house pattern. And then the business model you can combine all of those different compute. So that's the type of compute architecture. So it's sort of a -- so that's just one example.\n\nThe tool stuff is changing. Office, I mean, if you think about what -- if I look at Copilot; Copilot's extensibility with GPT, Copilot apps to the Copilot stack, that's another sort of part of what's happening to the tech stack. So yes, I mean, definitely builds.

I wanted to return to AI, the 6-point AI lift to Azure is just extraordinary, but I wanted to ask you about your progress in standing up the infrastructure to meet that demand.

Maybe I'll start and Satya feel free to add on. I think we feel really good about where we have been in terms of adding capacity. You started to see the acceleration in our capital expense starting almost a year ago, and you've seen us scale through that process.\n\nAnd that is going toward as we talked about Servers and also new data center footprints to be able to meet what we see as this demand and really changing demand as we look forward. And so I do feel like the team has done a very good job. I feel like, primarily obviously, this is being built by us, but we've also used third-party capacity to help when we could have that help us in terms of meeting customer demand. And I think looking forward, you'll tend to C&I guide toward it, accelerated capital expense to continue to be able to add capacity in the coming quarters, given what we see in terms of pipeline.\n\nBrett Iversen -- General Manager, Investor Relations"}, {"metadata": {"source": "data\\MSFT_q2_2024.txt", "last_update": "2024-08-30T18:11:49-00:00", "id": "doc-67-MSFT_q2_2024"}, "content": "Thanks, Karl. Joe, next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Brad Zelnick with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed.\n\nBrad Zelnick -- Deutsche Bank -- Analyst\n\nGreat. Thank you so much for taking the question. The early market feedback that we're all hearing on Microsoft 365 Copilot is very powerful. Can you provide more granularity on what you're seeing in terms of adoption trends versus perhaps other new product introductions in the past, what if anything is holding it back, and how much of a priority is it to get it in the hands of customers? To what lengths might you go to incentivize just getting it out in the market? Thank you.\n\nSatya Nadella -- Chief Executive Officer\n\nNo, thank you for the question, Brad. So a couple of things. In my comments I said increase in relation to our previous suites like, let's say, E3 or E5. Whatever two months in, it's definitely much faster than that."}, {"metadata": {"source": "data\\MSFT_q2_2024.txt", "last_update": "2024-08-30T18:11:49-00:00", "id": "doc-68-MSFT_q2_2024"}, "content": "And so from that perspective, it's exciting to see, I'd say, the demand signal, the deployment signal. I was looking at by tenant, even usage, it's faster than anything else because it's easier, right? I mean, it's sort of -- it shows up in your app, if you click on it, like any ribbon thing, and it becomes a daily habit. So it in fact, it reminds me a little bit of sort of the back in the day of PC adoption, right? It's kind of -- I think it first starts off with few people having access. There are many companies that are doing standard issue, right? So just like PCs became standard issue at some point after PCs being adopted by early adopters."}, {"metadata": {"source": "data\\MSFT_q2_2024.txt", "last_update": "2024-08-30T18:11:49-00:00", "id": "doc-69-MSFT_q2_2024"}, "content": "I think that's the cycle that at least we expect. In terms of what we're seeing, it's actually interesting, if you look at the data we have, summarization, that's what it's like, number one. Like I'm doing summarization of Teams meetings inside of Teams, during the meeting, after the meeting, Word documents summarization, I get something in email on summarizing. So summarization has become a big deal.\n\nDrafts, right, you're drafting emails, drafting documents. So anytime you want to start something, the blank page thing goes away and you start by prompting and drafting. Chat, to me, the most powerful feature is now you have the most important database in your company, which happens to be the database of your documents and communications. It is now queryable by natural language in a powerful way, right? I can go and say, what are all the things Amy said I should be watching out for next quarter, and it will come out with great detail."}, {"metadata": {"source": "data\\MSFT_q2_2024.txt", "last_update": "2024-08-30T18:11:49-00:00", "id": "doc-70-MSFT_q2_2024"}, "content": "And so Chat, summarization, draft, and also, by the way, actions. One of the most used thing is here's the Word document, go complete, I mean, create a PowerPoint for me. So those are the stuff that is also beginning. So I feel like these all become -- but fundamentally, what happens is, if you remember the PC adoption cycle, what it did was work artifact and workflow changed, right? You can imagine what forecasting was before Excel and email and what it was after.\n\nSo similarly, you'll see work and workflow change as people summarize faster, draft regulatory submissions faster, chat to get knowledge from your business.

One of the exciting things, as I said, for some companies, it's going to be standard issue like PC. For other companies, they may want to do a land with a smaller group, see the productivity gains, and then expand. And so being able to lift some of the seat requirements that we did earlier this month, it's really going to allow customers to be able to use that approach, too.\n\nAnd the other thing I would add, we always talk about in enterprise software. You sell software, then you wait, and then it gets deployed. And then after deployment, you want to see usage. And in particular, what we've seen and you would expect this, in some ways with Copilot."}, {"metadata": {"source": "data\\MSFT_q2_2024.txt", "last_update": "2024-08-30T18:11:49-00:00", "id": "doc-72-MSFT_q2_2024"}, "content": "Even in the early stages, obviously, deployment happens very quickly.

I'm just wondering, where did you see the strongest step up in that activity?\n\nAmy Hood -- Chief Financial Officer\n\nMark, without getting into tons of line items, it's more simple to think of it as, really, it's people adopting it for inferencing at the API generally. I mean, that's the easiest way to think about it. And we also saw growth in GitHub Copilot which you talked -- which Satya talked about, and we saw a growing number of third parties using it in some small ways for training.

Thanks very much. Amy, for many, many years in commercial Office 365 seat growth has far outpaced ARPU and over the last couple of quarters, we're getting a convergence, obviously, as the seat count gets really large. As we look forward, should they run even for a period of time? Or should we expect ARPU to outpace seat growth here in the short term? Thanks.\n\nAmy Hood -- Chief Financial Officer\n\nThat's a great question, Brad. Let me split apart the components. And then we can come back to whether they should equalize or just go on sort of a bit, actually believe it or not, somewhat independent trajectory and I will explain why I say that. Your seat growth as we talk about is primarily from, at this point, small and medium-sized businesses and really frontline workers scenarios."}, {"metadata": {"source": "data\\MSFT_q2_2024.txt", "last_update": "2024-08-30T18:11:49-00:00", "id": "doc-76-MSFT_q2_2024"}, "content": "And to your point on occasion, those are lower ARPU seats, but there are also -- there are new seats and so you see that in the seat count number.

So all of that, right, completely independent in some way from seat growth. Then the next thing that actually we just talked about, maybe in Brad's question, I'm trying to -- is that you're going to see Copilot revenue will run there as ARPU, right? That won't show a seat growth. So you'll have E3, E5 transition, Copilot all show up in ARPU over time, and then you'll have the seat growth be primarily still small business and frontline worker and maybe new industry scenarios.\n\nSo I tend to not really, Brad, think about them as related lines, believe it or not.

Satya, your enthusiasm about GitHub Copilot was noticeable on the conference call and at the AI Summit in New York last week. I'm wondering how you're thinking about pricing.

I mean -- it's -- I always go back to sort of my own conviction that this generation of AI is going to be different, started with the move from 2.5 to 3 of GPT and then its use inside of developer scenario with GitHub Copilot. And so yes, I think this is the place where it's most evolved. In terms of its economic benefits or productivity benefits, and you see it.\n\nWe see it inside of Microsoft. We see it in all of the key studies we put out of customers. Everybody had talked to its pickup, but it is the one place where it's becoming standard issue for any developer is like if you take away spellcheck from Word, I'll be unemployable.

I mean, if I look at it, our ARPUs have been great, but they're pretty low. Even though we've had a lot of success, it's not like we had a high-priced ARPU company. I think what you're going to start finding is, whether it's Sales Copilot or Service Copilot or GitHub Copilot or Security Copilot, they are going to fundamentally capture some of the value they drive in terms of the productivity of the opex, right? So it's like 2 points, 3 points of opex leverage would be goal is on software spend.

And so yes, I think all up, I do see this as a new vector for us in what I'll call the next phase of knowledge work and frontline work, even in their productivity and how we participate. And I think GitHub Copilot, I never thought of the tools business as fundamentally participating in the operating expenses of a company's spend on, let's say, development activity and now you're seeing that transition.\n\nIt is just not tools.
